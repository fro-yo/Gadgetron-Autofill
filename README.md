##Gadgetron PCB Bot

Download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gadgetron-pcb-bot/bkddnbpbnacegidlhhaladpcnhfhjhhg?hl=en&authuser=1)!

Downloads zipfiles generated by robots.gadgetron.build and fills in the forms
at 4pcb.com using the data generated for each robot. (You need to be on 4pcb.com/my4pcb.com to use this extension)

* Remember to turn off "Ask where to save each file before downloading" in
Chrome advanced settings as this interferes with the automatic downloading of
the zip files for each robot.

###Usage

* Enter the URL of gadgetron's json output (such as [this one](http://robots.gadgetron.build/usergroup/ag9zfnVjc2RnYWRnZXRyb25yFgsSCVVzZXJHcm91cBiAgIDA3IqdCgw/get_4pcb_ordering_data)) and click submit to download all the robots' zipfiles. 

 Each file will go in a folder called "gadgetronZipFiles" in Chrome's download destination directory.

* You will now see the list of robots to be ordered. Upload the first robot in the 4pcb upload page. 
* Click "Fill Form!" on the form page to fill the page for the corresponding robot. Perform the same actions for each robot.

 The forms will be filled in the order displayed in the extension - please make sure you upload the zipfiles in this order to avoid mismatched forms. 
* You can click "Previous" to go back and refill the details of a previous robot.
