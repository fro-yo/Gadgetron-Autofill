Gadgetron Autofill

Downloads zipfiles generated by robots.gadgetron.build and fills in the forms
at 4pcb.com using the data generated for each robot.

Remember to turn off "Ask where to save each file before downloading" in
Chrome advanced settings as this interferes with the automatic downloading of
the zip files for each robot.
